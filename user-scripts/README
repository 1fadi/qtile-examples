dmenu-session
-------------

This script creates nice dmenu at bottom with suggested actions for session.
It works with dmenu application, so it should be installed. Code was taken from 
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=95984

Copy to /usr/local/bin/dmenu-session. Change colors or prompt
to your needs. Change mod to executable.

    chmod +x dmenu-session

Bind key to your newly created script in Qtile config.

    <...>
    Key([mod, 'control'], 'q', lazy.spawn('dmenu-session')),
    <...>

What's it. Now after Qtile reload you should get nice menu at bottom.
